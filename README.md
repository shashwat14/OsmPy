# OsmPy
A python program for coverting a given map area to an adjacency list. Preserves actual distances in metres. 

# To do 
1. Create a simulation toolbox for running traffic related simulations
2. Write A\* algorithm for graph search (shortest path algorithm for finding distance between two given nodes)
3. Generating a map with only required nodes (ways with bus-stops, or taxi stations, etc)
